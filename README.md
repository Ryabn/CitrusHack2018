# What it does

Personally all of us hate waking up in the morning without an outfit in plan or even walking out with a great summer outfit, later to find out that it is cold outside (California weather amirite??).

WeatherFitTho generates outfits based on your personal preferences in style and the current weather in your location!

# How I built it

We built this using HTML, CSS, Javascript.

# Challenges I ran into

The majority of our team were beginners, thus, not all of us were familiar with all the languages used for this project or version control.

# Accomplishments that I'm proud of

wow much aesthetic

# What's next for WeatherFitTho
